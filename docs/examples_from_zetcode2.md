The following examples come from
[http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/constraints/](http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/constraints/).
Even though it is a SQLite tutorial the point is to show how to use this package
which does not have to be just SQLite.

```d
class BlankClassSoDocsWillBeGenerated;

```

**Examples:**

The second example is for the UNIQUE constraint and the PRIMARY KEY constraint.
The table in SQL can be created by
```sql
CREATE TABLE Brands
(
    Id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    BrandName TEXT UNIQUE
);


```


Any column marked with @PrimaryKeyColumn must also have @NotNull. Unlike SQLite,
if a column is marked as int and @PrimaryKeyColumn it is not auto-incremented.

```d

import db_constraints;

class Brand
{
    private int _Id;
    // marking Id with not null and primary key
    @NotNull @PrimaryKeyColumn
    @property int Id()
    {
        return _Id;
    }
    @property void Id(int value)
    {
        setter(_Id, value);
    }

    private string _BrandName;
    // marking BrandName with UniqueConstraintColumn
    // so the collection will know this property should be
    // unique for all records
    @UniqueConstraintColumn!("Unique")
    @property string BrandName()
    {
        return _BrandName;
    }
    @property void BrandName(string value)
    {
        setter(_BrandName, value);
    }

    this(int Id_, string BrandName_)
    {
        this._Id = Id_;
        this._BrandName = BrandName_;
        // do not forget to initialize the keyed item!
        initializeKeyedItem();
    }

    // do not forget to add in the keyed item!
    mixin KeyedItem!();
}

// this is what I call the plural class
// or table class. This is the collection
// of rows (in this example Brands).
class Brands
{
    // this mixin already does the
    // initializations and every method
    // I want for this tutorial so I
    // do not need anything else.
    mixin KeyedCollection!(Brand);
}

import std.exception : assertNotThrown, assertThrown;

// UNIQUE constraint
{
    // we can start by putting two records into the collection.
    // now brands holds a record for Coca Cola and Pepsi
    auto brands = new Brands([new Brand(1, "Coca Cola"),
                              new Brand(2, "Pepsi")]);

    auto anotherPepsi = new Brand(3, "Pepsi");
    // if we try to add another record that has Pepsi for
    // the brand name we will get a unique constraint exception
    assertThrown!UniqueConstraintException(brands.add(anotherPepsi));

    // we can see if the new record will violate any unique constraints
    // before we add it to the collection by using violatesUniqueConstraints
    assert(brands.violatesUniqueConstraints(anotherPepsi));
}

// PRIMARY KEY constraint
{
    // the primary key is unique and not null
    // by default we can use the primary key to look up
    // records in the collection
    auto brands = new Brands([new Brand(1, "Coca Cola"),
                              new Brand(2, "Pepsi")]);

    // since Pepsi's Id is the primary key we can use 2 to find pepsi
    assert(brands[2].BrandName == "Pepsi");
    assert(brands[2].Id == 2);
    // this is because brands is really an associative array that uses the
    // primary key in this case as the AA key. We can check if the
    // collection already contains a primary key of 2 by using contains
    assert(brands.contains(2));
    // and does not contain 4
    assert(!brands.contains(4));
    // if you try to get an item that is not there you will get an exception
    assertThrown!KeyedException(brands[4].BrandName);

    // lets add two more records
    brands ~= [new Brand(3, "Sun"), new Brand(4, "Oracle")];

    // now it does contain 4
    assert(brands.contains(4));
    assertNotThrown!KeyedException(brands[4].BrandName);
}

```
