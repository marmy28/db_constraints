***
```d
template generic_compare(T) if (is(T == struct))
```

Used in KeyedItem for the generated structs.
This allows the struct to be used as a key
in an associative array.

***
```d
final const nothrow @safe size_t toHash();

```

Gets the hash code of the struct by looping over the members.


***
```d
final const pure nothrow @nogc @safe bool opEquals(inout(T) pk);

```

Checks each member to determine if the structs are equal.


***
```d
final const pure nothrow @nogc @safe int opCmp(inout(T) pk);

```

Compares each member and returns the result.




***
```d
template UniqueConstraintStructNames(ClassName)
```

Gets the names given to the different UniqueConstraints

***
```d
template Impl(T...)
```

Takes a type tuple of class members and alias' as a typetuple with all unique constraint names


***
```d
template Overloads(S...)
```

Looks at the overloads for the functions.


***
```d
template Get(P...)
```

Takes a members attributes and finds if it has one that starts with UniqueConstraint




***
```d
template GetMembersWithUDA(ClassName, attribute)
```

Gets the properties of ClassName marked with @attribute.


***
```d
string ConstraintStructs(ClassName, string ClusteredIndexAttributeName)();

```

Returns a string full of the structs for ClassName.
